 (Now this part is created on my personnel opinion and may or may not be correct)
 ### An ideal Date can be broken down into Three Parts: 
 ### 1. _Food_:
 #### Food is an essential part of an outing, good food can brighten any dull evening and is great to get conversation started. Thus, we need to choose a location that can offer us great quality and variety of food.
 ### 2. _Activity_:
 #### There is nothing better than a shared activity to bring kindered spirits together than sharing a Activity, watching a movie, a match or visiting a museum... Sharing an activity will bring you closer to your partner and lift up your spirits.
 ### 3. _Drinks_:
 #### After such an amazing evening, it is time to relax with couple of drinks, so it will be great if we could find a great bar or pub nearby. A perfect end to a great evening. 
 
 ----
 ### Now that we have defined an ideal date, we need to find a location that can cater to all our needs so that we don't have to travel unnecessarily.
 ### Thus, It will be very helpful, If some smart programmer can work out locations that are ideal for our dream date.  
 ### Therefore we'll create a notebook that gives us list of locations in Toronto and give us an idea whether they are ideal for us or not. From the list of locations returned we can choose our choice and get ready for an awesome date.

## Part 2: Data We Need
### 1- We will need geo-locational information about that specific borough and the neighborhoods in that borough. We specifically and technically mean the latitude and longitude numbers of that borough. The Postal Codes that fall into Toronto would also be sufficient for us. In fact we will first find neighbourhoods inside Toronto by their corresponding Postal Codes.

### 2- We will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information we will use "Foursquare" locational information. By locational information for each venue we mean basic and advanced information about that venue. For example there is a venue in one of the neighborhoods. As basic information, we can obtain its precise latitude and longitude and also its distance from the center of the neighborhood. But we are looking for advanced information such as the category of that venue and whether this venue is a popular one in its category or maybe the average price of the services of this venue. A typical request from Foursquare will provide us with  the following information:
#### [Postal Code]\t[Neighborhood(s)]\t[Neighborhood Latitude]\t[Neighborhood Longitude]\t[Venue]\t[Venue Summary]\t[Venue Category]\t[Distance (meter)]
#### [M1L]\t[Clairlea, Golden Mile, Oakridge]\t[43.711112]\t[-79.284577]\t[Tim Hortons]\t[This spot is popular]\t[Coffee Shop]\t[592]"
